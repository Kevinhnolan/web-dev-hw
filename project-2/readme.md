This experience was a good one I think. I had to constantly review back to previous lessons for some help but it went good all in all! Most things I could remember the basis of but I think the most difficult for me is figuring out he "id" along with embedding images.

I'm definitely excited to learn more but also very nervous because I feel I'm just getting started with HTMl and now it's on to the next one! But that's okay, I'm sure Ill figure it out.

My work cycle this time involved more reviewing and reading the past sections. I continue to use some different websites such as "W3schools" which gives me some info on codes and forms and such.
