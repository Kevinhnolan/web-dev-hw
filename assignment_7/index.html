    Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
    <br>
    <br>

ANTONIO

<br>
<br>

    In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
    <br>
    It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
    <br>
    But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
    <br>
    What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
    <br>
    I am to learn;
    <br>
    And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
    <br>
    That I have much ado to know myself.
    <br>
    <br>

SALARINO
<br>
<br>
    Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
    <br>
    There, where your argosies with portly sail,
    <br>
    Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
    <br>
    Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
    <br>
    Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
    <br>
    That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
    <br>
    As they fly by them with their woven wings.
    <br>
    <br>

SALANIO
<br>
<br>
    Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
    <br>
    The better part of my affections would
    <br>
    Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
    <br>
    Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
    <br>
    Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
    <br>
    And every object that might make me fear
    <br>
    Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
    <br>
    Would make me sad.
<br>
<br>
SALARINO
<br>
<br>
    My wind cooling my broth
    <br>
    Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
    <br>
    What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
    <br>
    I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
    <br>
    But I should think of shallows and of flats,
    <br>
    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
    <br>
    Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
    <br>
    To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
    <br>
    And see the holy edifice of stone,
    <br>
    And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
    <br>
    Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
    <br>
    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
    <br>
    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
    <br>
    And, in a word, but even now worth this,
    <br>
    And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
    <br>
    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
    <br>
    That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
    <br>
    But tell not me; I know, Antonio
    <br>
    Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
<br>
<br>
ANTONIO
<br>
<br>
    Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
    <br>
    My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
    <br>
    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
    <br>
    Upon the fortune of this present year:
    <br>
    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
<br>
<br>
SALARINO
<br>
<br>
    Why, then you are in love.
