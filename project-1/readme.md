## Technical Report

-My primary web browser is Chrome but for Netflix I use Safari because my sisters account is saved to that browser!

-The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML code. Each time a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, images and links. The browser processes these items and renders them in the browser window.

-I visited a snapshot of google.com during the year 2000. Surprisingly enough there isn't a whole lot of change. The text on the page doesn't look nearly as professional along with the logo but all in all its pretty much the same!

-To begin I was a little confused with correct format of the files and how to put them where I wanted. Finding out how to preview html was difficult as well before I found some awesome help! After that it wasen't very hard. I followed instructions and reviewed some work/code done by previous students and figured it out! I'm unsure whether or not my image was put in correctly but other than that I think it went well!
