## Technical Report

B.) A page can have a number of different head and body elements. Some elements are required and some are recommended. Different head elements can be used to tell the browser and processor info about the HTML document, such as the title, author, publications ect. The bodys elements is where all the "meat and potatoes" come from. This data is rendered by the browser and displayed on the viewers computer screen.

C.) Within the body there are 2 different types of markup used. Structural Markup and Semantic Markup. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document such as paragraphs, headings, breaks or lists. Semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the documents with things like bold letters, underlines, strikethroughs, or italics.

D.) For this assignment I did it pretty much on my own! I followed each direction step by step and put the pieces of the puzzle together through trial and error. I used the information from the website and used the html preview and managed to put it together!
